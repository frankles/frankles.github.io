I'm so glad you chose to open this readme file.  Readme's generally do not get as much attention as they should,
much like instruction booklets that come with any new product or technology.  

Yes, I know, technology is a product.  I had an 8-bit Nintendo for almost ten years before I read the
instructions and realized all this blowing I've done on the cartridges was bad for them, and specified 
as a "do not" by the book.  Sorry, old console friend.  No going back now.
